# What is an algorithm? What is a computer?

Back when computers were human...

* Instructions
* (Small) working memory
* As much notepaper as you wanted
* Input → output

.float-right[![right-aligned Growth rates ](turing-machine.jpg)]
## Turing machines

Simplified human computer.

* (Instructions + memory) → Finite number of states
    * (States similar to places on a flowchart)
* Notepaper → tape (with limited symbols)

Algorithm is the instructions

(See TU100 Block 2 Part 1, M269 Unit 2)

---

# Sequence, selection, repetition

Repetition == iteration or recursion

What questions can we ask about algorithms?

* Is it correct?
* Does it terminate?
* How long does it take?

Different hardware works at different rates, so ask about how the run time changes with input size.

---

# Growth rates

`\(f(n) \text{ is } O(g(n)) \quad\text{ if }\quad |f(n)| \le \; M |g(n)|\text{ for all }n \ge N\)`

# Complexity classes we care about

* Exponential or bigger (2<sup>*n*</sup>, *e*<sup>*n*</sup>, or *n*!)
* Polynomial (*n*<sup>*k*</sup>)
* Linear (*n*)
* Sub-linear (log *n*)

Generally:

* polynomial or smaller is considered tractable 
* anything exponential or larger is intractable

(Exceptions exist in practice.)

# Anagrams version 1: checking off

```
Given word1, word2

anagram? = True
for character in word1:
    for pointer in range(len(word2)):
        if character == word2[pointer]:
            word2[pointer] = None
        else:
            anagram? = False
return anagram?
```

Nested loops: complexity is *O*(*n*₁ × *n*₂), or *O*(*n*²).

Can anyone see the bug?

word1 = "cat", word2 = "catty"

# Anagrams version 2: sort and comapre

```
Given word1, word2

return sorted(word1) == sorted(word2)
```

What's the complexity of `sorted`? What's the complexity of `==`?

---

# Anagrams version 2a: sort and comapre

```
Given word1, word2

sorted_word1 = sorted(word1)
sorted_word2 = sorted(word2)

anagram? = True
for i in range(len(sorted_word1)):
    if sorted_word1[i] != sorted_word2[i]:
        anagram? = False
return anagram?
```

One `for` in the comparison, so its complexity is *O*(*n*).

(`len` is also *O*(*n*))

What's the complexity of `sorted`? 

---

# Anagrams version 2a': sort and comapre, idiomatic

```
Given word1, word2

sorted_word1 = sorted(word1)
sorted_word2 = sorted(word2)

anagram? = True
for l1, l2 in zip_longest(sorted_word1, sorted_word2):
    if l1 != l2:
        anagram? = False
return anagram?
```

`zip_longest` is lazy, so still *O*(*n*).

(Can't use `zip` as it truncates the longest iterable, giving the same bug as number 1)

Still dominated by the *O*(*n* log *n*) of `sorted`.

---

# Anagrams version 3: permutations

```
Given word1, word2

anagram? = False
for w in permutations(word1):
    w == word2:
        anagram? = True
return anagram?
```

(Code for `permutations` is complex.)

How many permutations are there?

---

# Anagrams version 4: counters

```
Given word1, word2

counts1 = [0] * 26
counts2 = [0] * 26

for c in word1:
    counts1[num_of(c)] += 1

for c in word2:
    counts2[num_of(c)] += 1

anagram? = True
for i in range(26):
    if counts1[i] != counts2[1]:
        anagram = False
return anagram?
```

Three `for`s, but they're not nested. Complexity is *O*(*n*₁ + *n*₂ + 26) or *O*(*n*).

`dict`s seem a natural way of representing the count. What do you need to be careful of?

(Alternative: maintain a single list of differences in letter counts. Initialise to all zero, should be all zero when you've finished.)

Notice: trading space for time.

---

# Finding all anagrams

Given a `wordlist` and a `word`, find all anagrams of `word` in `wordlist`.

* How does your answer change if you know you need to do this just once, or millions of times?

# Anagrams of phrases

Given a wordlist and a phrase, find another phrase that's an anagram.

# Turing and computability

(Following [Craig Kaplan's description of the Halting Problem](http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/halt/))

## The Entscheidungsproblem (Decision problem)

Given some axioms, rules of deduction, and a statement (input), can you prove whether the statement follows from the axioms?

The rules could be described to a human computer.

The computer would either answer "Yes," "No," or never stop working.

This is the Halting problem.

```python
while i != 0:
    print(i)
    i -= 1
```

Will this halt? When will it not?

---

# Universal Turing machine

.float-right[![A computer](human-computer-worksheet.png)]

A Turing machine does one particular job

But you can describe how to do that job to another person

In other words, you can treat the instructions as the input to another machine

A *universal* Turing machine can take the description of any Turing machine and produce the same output

* Instruction = input
* Program = data

*This* shows that computing as we know it is possible.

* Programming
* Abstraction
* Virtual machines
* ...

---

# Back to halting

* Universal Turing machine can do any possible computation
* Has the same halting behaviour of the emulated machine

Can we build another machine that detects if a machine halts when given some input?

Assume we can...

```python
def does_it_stop(program, input):
    if very_clever_decision:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

But I can use the program listing as an input:

```python
def stops_on_self(program):
    return does_it_stop(program, program)
```

---

# Halting: the clever bit

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td>
```python
def does_it_stop(program, input):
    if very_clever_decision:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
</td>
<td>
```python
def stops_on_self(program):
    return does_it_stop(program, program)
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Let's put an infinite loop in a program that detects infinite loops!

```python
def bobs_yer_uncle(program):
    if stops_on_self(program):
        while True:
            pass
    else:
        return True
```

If a `program` halts on on itself, `bobs_yer_uncle` doesn't halt. If `program` doesn't halt, `bobs_yer_uncle` returns `True`.

--

What does this do?
```python
bobs_yer_uncle(bobs_yer_uncle)
```

---

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td>
```python
def does_it_stop(program, input):
    if very_clever_decision:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
</td>
<td>
```python
def stops_on_self(program):
    return does_it_stop(program, program)
```
</td>
<td>
```python
def bobs_yer_uncle(program):
    if stops_on_self(program):
        while True:
            pass
    else:
        return True
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

What does this do?
```python
bobs_yer_uncle(bobs_yer_uncle)
```

<table>
<tr>
<th>If it halts...</th>
<th>If doesn't halt...</th>
</td>
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>`stops_on_self(bobs_yer_uncle)` returns `False`</li>
<li>`does_it_stop(bobs_yer_uncle, bobs_yer_uncle)` returns `False`</li>
<li>`bobs_yer_uncle(bobs_yer_uncle)` must loop forever</li>
</ul>
<b>Contradiction!</b>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>`stops_on_self(bobs_yer_uncle)` returns `True`</li>
<li>`does_it_stop(bobs_yer_uncle, bobs_yer_uncle)` returns `True`</li>
<li>`bobs_yer_uncle(bobs_yer_uncle)` must halt</li>
</ul>
<b>Contradiction!</b>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

No flaw in the logic. The only place there could be a mistake is our assumption that `does_it_stop` is possible.

(M269 has a different proof based on different sizes of infinity, and showing that there are infinitely more problems than there are Turing machines to solve them.)
