# Algorithms

## What's all the fuss about?

# What is an algorithm? What is a computer?

Back when computers were human...

* Instructions
* (Small) working memory
* As much notepaper as you wanted
* Input → output

## Turing machines

Simplified human computer.

* (Instructions + memory) → Finite number of states
    * (States similar to places on a flowchart)
* Notepaper → tape (with limited symbols)

Algorithm is the instructions

(See TU100 Block 2 Part 1, M269 Unit 2)

---

# Sequence, selection, repetition

Repetition == iteration or recursion

---

# Growth rates

![left-aligned Growth rates ](big-o-chart-smaller.png) .float-right[![right-aligned Growth rates ](big-o-chart-2-smaller.png)]

`\(f(n) \text{ is } O(g(n)) \quad\text{ if }\quad |f(n)| \le \; M |g(n)|\text{ for all }n \ge N\)`

---
# Complexity classes we care about

* Exponential or bigger (2<sup>*n*</sup>, *e*<sup>*n*</sup>, or *n*!)
* Polynomial (*n*<sup>*k*</sup>)
* Linear (*n*)
* Sub-linear (log *n*)

Generally:

* polynomial or smaller is considered tractable 
* anything exponential or larger is intractable

(Exceptions exist in practice.)

# Anagrams version 1: checking off

```
Given word1, word2

anagram? = True
for character in word1:
    for pointer in range(len(word2)):
        if character == word2[pointer]:
            word2[pointer] = None
        else:
            anagram? = False
return anagram?
```

Nested loops: complexity is *O*(*n*₁ × *n*₂), or *O*(*n*²).

--

Can anyone see the bug?

--

word1 = "cat", word2 = "catty"

---

# Anagrams version 1a: checking off (fixed)

```
Given word1, word2

anagram? = True
for character in word1:
    for pointer in range(len(word2)):
        if character == word2[pointer]:
            word2[pointer] = None
        else:
            anagram? = False
for pointer in range(len(word2)):
    if word2[pointer] != None:
        anagram? = False
return anagram?
```

---

# Anagrams version 2: sort and comapre

```
Given word1, word2

return sorted(word1) == sorted(word2)
```

What's the complexity of `sorted`? What's the complexity of `==`?

---

# Anagrams version 2a: sort and comapre

```
Given word1, word2

sorted_word1 = sorted(word1)
sorted_word2 = sorted(word2)

anagram? = True
for i in range(len(sorted_word1)):
    if sorted_word1[i] != sorted_word2[i]:
        anagram? = False
return anagram?
```

One `for` in the comparison, so its complexity is *O*(*n*).

(`len` is also *O*(*n*))

What's the complexity of `sorted`? 

---

# Anagrams version 2a': sort and comapre, idiomatic

```
Given word1, word2

sorted_word1 = sorted(word1)
sorted_word2 = sorted(word2)

anagram? = True
for l1, l2 in zip_longest(sorted_word1, sorted_word2):
    if l1 != l2:
        anagram? = False
return anagram?
```

`zip_longest` is lazy, so still *O*(*n*).

(Can't use `zip` as it truncates the longest iterable, giving the same bug as number 1)

Still dominated by the *O*(*n* log *n*) of `sorted`.

---

# Anagrams version 3: permutations

```
Given word1, word2

anagram? = False
for w in permutations(word1):
    w == word2:
        anagram? = True
return anagram?
```

(Code for `permutations` is complex.)

How many permutations are there?

---

# Anagrams version 4: counters

```
Given word1, word2

counts1 = [0] * 26
counts2 = [0] * 26

for c in word1:
    counts1[num_of(c)] += 1

for c in word2:
    counts2[num_of(c)] += 1

anagram? = True
for i in range(26):
    if counts1[i] != counts2[1]:
        anagram = False
return anagram?
```

Three `for`s, but they're not nested. Complexity is *O*(*n*₁ + *n*₂ + 26) or *O*(*n*).

`dict`s seem a natural way of representing the count. What do you need to be careful of?

(Alternative: maintain a single list of differences in letter counts. Initialise to all zero, should be all zero when you've finished.)

Notice: trading space for time.

---

# Finding all anagrams

Given a `wordlist` and a `word`, find all anagrams of `word` in `wordlist`.

* How does your answer change if you know you need to do this just once, or millions of times?

# Anagrams of phrases

Given a wordlist and a phrase, find another phrase that's an anagram.

# Dealing with complex problems: some terms to know

(M269 Unit 5)

## Divide and Conquer

* Split a problem into smaller parts
* Solve them
* Combine the sub-solutions
* Often leads to logarithmic growth

"Guess the number" game
    * What if I don't tell you the upper limit?

## Dynamic programming

Build a soluion bottom-up from subparts

---

# Heuristics

* Posh word for "guess"
* Greedy algorithms
* Backtracking

---

# Making change

Given

* some money and a set of coin denominations,

find

* the smallest number of coins to make that total.

## Approach 1: greedy

```
Repeat:
   Pick the biggest coin you can
```

Only works in some cases

(What the best way to make 7p if you have 1p, 3p, 4p, 5p coins?)

# Making change 2: exhaustive search

# Turing and computability

(Following [Craig Kaplan's description of the Halting Problem](http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/halt/))

## The Entscheidungsproblem (Decision problem)

Given some axioms, rules of deduction, and a statement (input), can you prove whether the statement follows from the axioms?

The rules could be described to a human computer.

The computer would either answer "Yes," "No," or never stop working.

This is the Halting problem.

# Universal Turing machine

.float-right[![A computer](human-computer-worksheet.png)]

A Turing machine does one particular job

But you can describe how to do that job to another person

In other words, you can treat the instructions as the input to another machine

A *universal* Turing machine can take the description of any Turing machine and produce the same output

* Instruction = input
* Program = data

*This* shows that computing as we know it is possible.
